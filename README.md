ABOUT
===================================================================
ArdiChef is a project that will attempt to automate home cooking
and cleaning.  The project will utilize
    - Arduino microcontroller kits
    - 3D Printed food dispensing parts
    - Purchased pumps, motors and miscellaneous hardware

ArdiChef will take a factory automation approach in dealing with
food preparation much like a in-home food factory.
